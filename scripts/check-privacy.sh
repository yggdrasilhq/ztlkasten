# Refuse to let private material into this repo, which is destined to be PUBLIC.
#
# Why this exists here in particular: ztlkasten's specification is EXTRACTED from
# a working vault, and that vault is the owner's personal journal. The single
# most likely defect in this repo is a real note title, folder name or person
# copied into a document because it was in front of the writer. Ported from the
# sibling repo, where that exact leak was found in tracked fixtures twice.
#
# ⛔ THE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES, and the thing that makes it different from a
# secret scanner: the leak vector here is NEVER a secret. It is an agent
# writing a REAL example into a test fixture or a comment because a real
# example was in front of it. Use invented examples. Always.
#
# ⛔ This checker must not itself become the leak. It matches SHAPES where it
# can (a numbered row title looks the same whatever it is called), and where it
# must name something it holds the term base64-encoded, so the word is not
# greppable in a public tree. Never add a plaintext private term below.
#
# Exit non-zero with the offending lines; silence means clean.

# Tracked files AND untracked-but-not-ignored ones, minus vendored/third-party

#
# ⛔ WHY UNTRACKED FILES ARE IN SCOPE, learned 2026-08-09: this checker is meant
# to run BEFORE a commit, and before a commit a newly written doc is exactly
# `??` — untracked. Scanning `git ls-files` alone therefore reported "ok" on a
# file containing a real home path, a private store name and a host name,
# because the file had not been added yet. The one moment the lock exists to
# cover was the one moment it could not see. Verified by writing a deliberately
# leaky file and watching the checker pass.
#
# `--exclude-standard` keeps .gitignore'd build output out, so this stays fast
# and does not flood on target/ or node_modules.

#    lanes is not. Add new synthetic labels here rather than weakening the rule.
